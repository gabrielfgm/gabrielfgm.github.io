I am a Lecturer in British Economic History in the [Department of History at King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/history). Before moving to London I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse](www.iast.fr), and prior to that I was a Marie-Curie Early Stage Research Fellow in the [Department of Economics at the University of Oxford](http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/). I completed my PhD in History with a minor in Economics at the [Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva](http://graduateinstitute.ch) in 2016. My research focuses on 19th century financial history, in particular the financial press, rating agencies, speculative manias and stock exchanges. I am also interested in the use of networks in studying economic history and Bayesian econometrics.
