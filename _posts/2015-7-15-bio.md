I am a Marie-Curie Early Stage Research Fellow in the [Department of Economics at the University of Oxford](http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/). I completed my PhD in History with a minor in Economics at the [Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva](http://graduateinstitute.ch) in 2016. My research focuses on 19th century financial history, in particular the financial press, rating agencies, speculative manias and financial crises. My current projects include measuring the prevalence of fraud during the railway mania of 1845 using a new database and the application of statistical learning algorithms, a network analysis of the British Parliament in the 1840's to detect evidence of logrolling, and an analysis of the industrial organization of the financial press during the railway mania. My past research projects include a history of mercantile agencies in the 19th century US, and a comparative study investigating why credit rating emerged in the US as opposed to Britain.
