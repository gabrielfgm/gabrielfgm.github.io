### Short Bio:

I am a Marie-Curie Early Stage Research Fellow in the [Department of Economics at the University of Oxford](http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/), and a PhD student in the [Department of International History at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva](http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/study/academicdepartments/international-history.html). My research focuses on 19th century financial history, in particular the financial press, rating agencies, speculative manias and financial crises. I am writing my thesis on the promotion of railway companies during the British Railway Mania of the 1840's, and the mania's impact on the financial press. In tandem, I am involved in a research project with Marc Flandreau into the origins of mercantile agencies in the 19th century, and a research project with Rui Esteves into political corruption and finance in mid-19th century Britain.
